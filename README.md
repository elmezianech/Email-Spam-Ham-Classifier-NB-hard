# Email-Spam-Ham-Classifier-NB-hard
Naive Bayes Email Classifier: An implementation of a 'hard' Naive Bayes classifier in Python to categorize emails as spam or ham. This code performs extensive data preprocessing, probability calculations, and model training for email classification using the raw Naive Bayes algorithm. The implementation directly computes probabilities and handles missing values using constant value imputation.

This project used the "Email Dataset for Spam Detection" sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains a collection of emails labeled as spam and ham for training and testing the classifier.
